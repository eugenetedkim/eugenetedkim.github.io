					Sorting
				</h2>
				<p>
					Each record (collection of data) contains a key, which is the value to be sorted, and the remainder of the record consists of satellite data, which are usually carried around with the key.

					permutation (noun): the action of changing the arrangement, especially the linear order, of a set of items.

					<ul>
						<li>
							O(<i>n</i>lg<i>n<i/>) worst case - like merge sort.
						</li>
						<li>
							Sorts in place - like insertion sort.

						<li>
							Combines the best of both algorithms.

					</ul>

					To understand heapsort, we'll cover heaps and heap operations, and then we'll take a look at priority queues.
